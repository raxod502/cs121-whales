"""
Module containing the backend models which users can select to play
against in the app. A model is a function that takes a PGN string and
returns a new PGN string with an additional move. Passing a model a PGN
string that is a completed game produces an unspecified result, but
should not be an error. (Malformed PGN may produce an InvalidPGNError.)

For convenience, mostly this module defines functions which *return* a
model, so that you can easily construct models with different parameters
substituted in.
