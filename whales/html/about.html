      <h1>About W.H.A.L.E.S.</h1>
      W.H.A.L.E.S. is a web application that allows you to play chess
      against an AI opponent using <span class="troll">neural networks</span>
      and <span class="troll">deep learning</span>.

      <h2>Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          From the <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="homeLink">home page</a>,
          you can select a color for your pieces and an AI model to play
          against, then start a game.
        </li>

        <li>
          When it is your turn, click and drag one of your pieces to
          make a move. After thinking, the AI will respond and return
          control to you.
        </li>

        <li>
          At any time, you can also undo the last move, restart the game
          from the beginning, or return to the home page to change your
          selected color or AI model.
        </li>

        <li>
          To save a game, simply bookmark the page. If you return later,
          you can start right where you left off.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>About the AI</h2>
      <p>
          We would like to give a special thanks to the contributors of 
          <a href="https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero">chess-alpha-zero</a>, whose 
          pretrained neural network was used for the intermediate and hard AI difficulties.
          Their network has been trained to output a (policy, value) prediction for a
          chess game state input. The policy is an array of probabilities of representing the 
          likelihood of making each legal move. The value represents the likelihood of the 
          moving player winning the game. 
          <br><br>
          Below is a quick summary of how each difficulty level selects a move.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Easy:</i> Chooses a random move from a list of legal moves
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Intermediate:</i> Utilizes a minimax algorithm of depth 1, using the value of the board from
          the neural network as the evaluation function
        </li>
        <li>
          <i>Hard:</i> Utilizes a minimax algorithm depth 2, using the value of the board from
          the neural network as the evaluation function
        </li>
      </ul>
